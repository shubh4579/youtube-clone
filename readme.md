# YouTube Clone (MERN Stack)

A full-stack YouTube-style video-sharing application built with **React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.

This project replicates the **core functionality of YouTube** — including video playback, user authentication, comments, likes/dislikes, and channel management — while serving as a hands-on learning project for the MERN stack.
